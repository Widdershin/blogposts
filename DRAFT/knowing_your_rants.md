# Knowing your rants

Do you know the topics which you tend to rant on?
Most people have them, and it's been my experience that finding out what yours are can be super great.
Why? 

The obvious would be to be more socially aware and minimize damage to your relationships.

More significantly though, I think rants are a rich source of infomation about yourself.
Why are you ranting on that topic?
It's either a topic which is inconsequential and you need to reasses how your value things in your life,
or you're luck enough to have discovered something you really care about A LOT.

Knowing your rants is a good defense against being triggered and inflicting a rant on someone.
Knowing your rants and confronting them is also a better path to not having them used against you.

## How to handle your rants

If you notice yourself giving a rant more than 5 times, you should write a blog post about it.
That way, you're challenged to be a more articulate, and think through the idea more cleary, AND people can choose whether or not to subject themselves to it.

At the very least you should start a scrap document (or git repo) - somewhere to collect your ideas.
That way you have a bookmarked location to add to, and on the offchance your partly articulated thought-stub is useful to someone else, you can expand it.
