# Autonomy and Autonomous

There are two trends I see in the crypto space :
  - systems of autonomy
  - autonomous systems

Both are exploring the possibility space afforded by cryptography (a.k.a. cypherspace).
I think both are interested in what can be improved upon in our human systems using these new tools.

There are some interesting assumptions about how systems behave and what the best solutions with these two approaches.

Autonomous systems as we're seeing them emerge in the crypto space are predominantly 'smart contracts'.
The presumption here is that humans make systems worse, that fuzzyness, interpretation and error need to be eliminated to increase reliability.
The problem with this is that it's very hard to write an algorithm which covers all uses cases perfectly.

I think smart contracts are likely to be 


Autonomous 
  - smart contracts
  - brittle / brutal
  - pre-figured
    - you have to have future sight


Edge computing
  - computing happens near the action
  - resiliance
  - adaptation

  - silver computer / humans
    - storage and computation are synonymous


Autonomy / Augmented
  - like edge computing
  - affords flexibility
