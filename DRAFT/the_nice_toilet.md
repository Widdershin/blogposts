# The nice toilet

In 2015 I attended a 6 week open hardware hackathon in a castle outside Paris.
Castles are not as romantic as you might think - the walls are too thick for wifi, and they were built before the advent of flushing toilets.
Anyway, we were basically running a small uncoordinated eco-village complete with a chores roster.
My favourite job was emptying the composting toilets.



- nice toilet
- bad undies
- shit coffee ? 
- red end of tape

components : 
- make a desirability gradient
- let time pass
- you will always have a backup and know when the ting is running out
