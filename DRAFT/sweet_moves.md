# Sweet Moves

A collection of sweet moves / approaches / lenses I've learnt from friends


## Thank you for that feedback

_Derek Razo_

Giving (critical) feedback to people is a challenging thing to do.
If the first thing the recipient responds with is "thank you", it changes the dynamic dramatically - the giver feels heard and set at ease, and the receiver puts themself in a position of genuine listening and acknowledgement of opportunity for learning.

The ~opposite of this would be immediate refute, explanation, or aggressive counter-feedback.


## Personal responsibility

_Billy Matheson_

Noticing when a person (yourself or other) are attributing responsibility outside of self when it would be more appropriate for individual to be taking personal responsibility.

Corollary: taking personal responsibility for how much personal responsibility you're taking in a given situation


## Getting psyched

_Derek Thatcher_

> How do you get psyched about getting in the sea (to go surfing) when you know it's going to be cold, and those breakers are gonna smash you?
> Derek : Getting psyched is like a muscle - the more you practice, the easier it is to get excited about things.

You get excited about things (and life) be practicing getting excited about life


## I just put on my shoes

_Jess Shanks_

> How do you motivate yourself to go running every morning?
> Jess : I don't, I just put on my running shoes then walk out the door. Usually once I'm outside I find jogging is nice
