# Content-addressable Commons
# How removing spacial location is revolutionising the world

For most of human history, information has been location bound - libraries, hard disks, websites, even the cloud.
In other words, you needed to know _where_ information is in order to read it.

This is no longer true, but it's a relatively new idea, and the implications are only now starting to ripple into main stream society.
We're seeing this technology manifest in things that look like massively efficient distribution (bit-torrent), decentralised coordination of open software projects (git), currency decoupled from state (bitcoin), and community spaces free from corporate data mining and advertising (scuttlebutt).

This simple idea is already changing major industry and economies.
I think we're poised on the edge of some major societal changes, join me for some how and why.


## Finding things without location

We're used to finding things by following address locations: 
- 65 Victoria St, Wellington, 6011
- /home/mix/projects/blogposts/content_addressable_commons.md
- www.scuttlebutt.nz
- facebook.com  username: ******   password: ******

Imagine a world with magic where things around you had common names, but also had unique _true names_.
A true name holds power - because it is unique, you can summon that thing to you at any time, from anywhere in the world, and will know it as soon as you see it.

We live in such a world, but the magic is called _mathematics_ (acutally there are a few schools), and the true name of some content is called it's hash.
A magician who knows a hashing incantation can cast a hashing algorithm on any file and it will produce the unique hash name, like: `%+fBXl12aV1wpAdD62RMl1WRhwthDMuAuHH4iNWgB7jA=.sha256`.

We can find the hash of any piece of content, and no matter the size, it will produce a unique (if somewhat unintelligible) string of characters, which is the same length, not matter the size of your content.

How do I use this?
When I wanted feedback on this article, I pushed it out into the web, and asked for a review or a file with a given hash.
Friends didn't need to got to www.somecompany.com, they just asked those around them for knowledge of a file with that specific hash.
It could have come from github.com, or git.scuttlebot.io, or git.mixmix.io, or the laptop sitting next to them - the point is it could have been located anywhere.

But what if someone intercepted it and change the file maliciously.
People can intercept the file and change it, but that changes the nature of the file, which changes its unique name.
(In technical terms, the has that is generating when you cast a hashing algorithm will change if even you only one character is changed in a file).
This means that the unique name is a great way to confirm the integrity of some content as well.
This is actually one of the main current uses for

If you don't know what content-addressable storage is, this is a must-read.
I'll offer a primer to the concept, then talk about ways it can and is changing organisation radically.

  - filing systems

- why this is a problem in the present

  - interoperability (painful reminder)
