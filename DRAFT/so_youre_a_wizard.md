Part I: Perceptions of Magic in Oldworld 
--------------------------------

On the whole, Oldworld is woefully uneducated when it comes to Magic.

Most people you encounter will have little idea of what powers you actually possess.
In absense of knowledge, expect to have superstition and folk-lore projected at you. 

Common misconceptions you'll encounter: 
- you aren't a wizard if you don't have a beard
- wizards are anti-social
- wizarding is about writing the code!

These can be intensely frustrating to deal with, but lets not jump to dropping the database.
(Changing perceptions is covered in Part 3.)

What's important to understand here is that most of these unproductive perceptions are borne of fear.
Many of the communities you'll interact with have been built on foundations of ownership and control, where the currency is power.

As a wizard, you're powerful, but in _~strange~_ and _unknowable_ ways.
Some people will find this combination threatening, so be prepared for each of the following (alone or in concert):

### Stereotypes being used to minimise your role

Stereotypes are lazy short-hand thinking.
Applying Empathy and Clarifying Question can be a great way to gently correct this anti-pattern.


### Superstitious reverence/ worship

Because most people don't understand Magic, it's important you support them by managing their expectations about the scope (and limitations) of what is possible.
Be careful not to fall into hubris by accepting unwarrented praise - it's safer to correct peoples understandings of your achievements so they don't later ask you to resurrect lost data.


### Mis-directed requests

You'll likely also encounter 'business owners' seeking to employ you to weave spells with [no appreciation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg
) of either cost nor suitability.
APIs, AIs, NFC, IoT, Blockchains seem to get a lot of people super excited.

Many owners are grasping at a solution to a problem they have, but name the latest crazes in Magic that they're heard about.
They are doing their best to hit 'KPIs' (key performace indicators), or maximise 'ROI' (return on investment), or in other words act in Integrity within the definition of their strucutres.
Asking for help or guidance on Magics often can't be done directly, because it can present as being Out of Integrity.

Remember your Empathy training, and listen for the deeper problems, not just the superficial presentations.
Use tools like Listening and Looping, Inviting Questions, and Requesting Feedback (either formally or informally) to deeply grok peoples fears and desires.


### Oldworld 'management'

The greatest danger to watch out for is "Waterfall projects", or perhaps worse "Wagile projects".
In a bid to manage risks, some organisations will try to plan and measure everything before they've even started weaving their spells.
While every wizard knows it's dangerous to commit to large spells and not adapt as casting progresses, many organisations are still to afraid to be able to Iterate.
